# 🌐 OSINT Labs Portfolio  

This folder contains a collection of **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) labs** showcasing practical, hands-on experience using various OSINT tools.  
Each subfolder represents a **different OSINT tool**, with multiple labs demonstrating data collection, analysis, and visualization techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop mastery in multiple OSINT tools.  
- Collect and analyze data ethically from publicly available sources.  
- Transform raw data into actionable intelligence using Python, CSV parsing, and network visualization.  
- Document workflows for reproducibility and professional presentation on GitHub.  

---

## 🧰 OSINT Tools Included
- 🕵️ **TheHarvester** – email and subdomain discovery  
- 🕵️ **Shodan** – internet-connected devices and services enumeration  
- 🕵️ **Maltego** – relationship mapping and graph analysis  
- 🕵️ **SpiderFoot** – automated OSINT collection  
- 🕵️ **Custom Python scripts** – parsing, cleaning, and visualizing OSINT data  

> Each tool folder contains one or more labs demonstrating a step-by-step OSINT workflow.

## 📝 Lab Workflow (General)
1. **Identify target** – select domain, organization, or IP range.  
2. **Run OSINT tool** – collect emails, subdomains, open ports, or other intelligence.  
3. **Export data** – typically JSON or CSV format.  
4. **Analyze data** – use Python, Pandas, and visualization libraries.  
5. **Visualize relationships** – generate network graphs or reports.  
6. **Document results** – maintain lab-specific README.md with screenshots, scripts, and lessons learned.
