# 🌐 OSINT Labs Portfolio  

This folder contains a collection of **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) labs** showcasing practical, hands-on experience using various OSINT tools.  
Each subfolder represents a **different OSINT tool**, with multiple labs demonstrating data collection, analysis, and visualization techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop mastery in multiple OSINT tools.  
- Collect and analyze data ethically from publicly available sources.  
- Transform raw data into actionable intelligence using Python, CSV parsing, and network visualization.  
- Document workflows for reproducibility and professional presentation on GitHub.  

---

## 🧰 OSINT Tools Included
- 🕵️ **TheHarvester** – email and subdomain discovery  
- 🕵️ **Shodan** – internet-connected devices and services enumeration  
- 🕵️ **Maltego** – relationship mapping and graph analysis  
- 🕵️ **SpiderFoot** – automated OSINT collection  
- 🕵️ **Custom Python scripts** – parsing, cleaning, and visualizing OSINT data  

> Each tool folder contains one or more labs demonstrating a step-by-step OSINT workflow.

## 📝 Lab Workflow (General)
1. **Identify target** – select domain, organization, or IP range.  
2. **Run OSINT tool** – collect emails, subdomains, open ports, or other intelligence.  
3. **Export data** – typically JSON or CSV format.  
4. **Analyze data** – use Python, Pandas, and visualization libraries.  
5. **Visualize relationships** – generate network graphs or reports.  
6. **Document results** – maintain lab-specific README.md with screenshots, scripts, and lessons learned.  

---

## 📖 How to Use
- Navigate to a tool folder to see available labs:  

```markdown
- 📁 [TheHarvester Labs](./TheHarvester-Labs)
- 📁 [Shodan Labs](./Shodan-Labs)
- 📁 [Maltego Labs](./Maltego-Labs)
- 📁 [SpiderFoot Labs](./SpiderFoot-Labs)
````

* Each lab folder contains:

  * Scripts used for automation and data parsing
  * CSV/JSON output files
  * Network graph visualizations (PNG)
  * Lab-specific README.md documenting objectives, commands, and lessons

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

* Mastery of OSINT data collection tools.
* Parsing, cleaning, and automating intelligence workflows in Python.
* Visualizing networks and relationships with NetworkX & Matplotlib.
* Linux file management and scripting proficiency.
* Professional lab documentation suitable for GitHub portfolios.

---

## 🔗 Notes

* All labs are built and tested on **Kali Linux**.
* This README should serve as the **entry point** to explore all OSINT work in this repository.
* Update this file as new OSINT tools and labs are added.

```

✅ **Benefits of this structure:**
- Gives a **professional overview** of all your OSINT work.  
- Serves as a **hub** for recruiters to explore labs by tool.  
- Standardizes workflow documentation for every lab.  
- Easy to expand when you add new tools or labs.  

---

If you want, I can **also create a template for each tool-specific folder README.md** (like TheHarvester, Shodan, Maltego) that links to each lab inside it. This makes the repo **fully navigable and professional**.  

Do you want me to do that next?
