# 🧠 John the Ripper Lab Series

Welcome to my **John the Ripper** lab series.  
These labs simulate real-world password cracking techniques using **Kali Linux**, **John the Ripper**, and essential tools used in offensive security.

Each lab walks through hands-on examples, showing how ethical hackers might recover passwords from hashed or encrypted data.

## 📂 Labs Overview

### 🔐 [Lab 1: Crack SHA-512 Password Hash](./Lab1/README-lab1.md)  
Learn how to simulate post-exploitation on a Linux system by cracking a **SHA-512** password hash using `openssl`, `unshadow`, and **John the Ripper**.

### 🗜️ [Lab 2: Crack Encrypted ZIP File](./Lab2/README.md)  
Crack the password of a **ZIP file** encrypted with `zip -e` using `zip2john` + **John the Ripper** with the `rockyou.txt` wordlist.

### 🧪 [Lab 3: Custom User Shadow Attack - Kuzan](./lab3/README.md)  
Crack a SHA-512 hash for a fake Linux user named **kuzan** using a custom lab setup. This simulates how an attacker would retrieve and crack hashes from `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`.
